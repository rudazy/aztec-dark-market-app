/**
 * Asynchronous native backend that communicates with bb binary via Unix Domain Socket.
 * Uses event-based I/O with a state machine to handle partial reads.
 *
 * Architecture: bb acts as the SERVER, TypeScript is the CLIENT
 * - bb creates the socket and listens for connections
 * - TypeScript waits for socket file to exist, then connects
 *
 * Protocol:
 * - Request: 4-byte little-endian length + msgpack buffer
 * - Response: 4-byte little-endian length + msgpack buffer
