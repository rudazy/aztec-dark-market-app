/**
 * Keeps track of heap allocations so they can be easily freed.
 * The WASM memory layout has 1024 bytes of unused "scratch" space at the start (addresses 0-1023).
 * We can leverage this for IO rather than making expensive bb_malloc bb_free calls.
 * Heap allocations will be created for input/output args that don't fit into the scratch space.
 * Input scratch grows UP from 0, output scratch grows DOWN from 1024, meeting in the middle.
 * This maximizes space utilization while preventing overlap.
